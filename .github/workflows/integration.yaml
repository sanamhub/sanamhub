      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout Repository

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (required for npx)

      # Step 3: Deploy only index.html to Surge using npx
      # npx executes the surge command without needing a global install
      # We specify './index.html' as the file to deploy
