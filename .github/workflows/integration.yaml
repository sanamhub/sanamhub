# Trigger the workflow on pushes to the main branch (or any branch)
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Or specify the branch you want to deploy from, e.g., [ main ] or use '[*]' for any branch

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js (required for npx)
      # Although we avoid global install, npx itself needs Node.js environment
      - name: setup node.js for npx

        with:
          # Use a recent LTS version is generally recommended
          node-version: "22" # Or '20', 'lts/*'

      # Step 3: Deploy only index.html to Surge using npx
      # npx executes the surge command without needing a global install
      # We specify './' as the dir to deploy
      - name: deploy to surge
        run: npx surge ./ ${{ secrets.SURGE_DOMAIN_SANAM }} --token ${{ secrets.SURGE_TOKEN_SANAM }}
